# Introduction

I cleaned some of the data prior to analyses. I had to:

1) Filter participants that have either T1 or T2 subfield data from scan
2) Select sex hormone measures from when scan was conducted
3) Correct T1 and T2 subfield volumes using TIV, which is a combination of GMV, WMV, CSF
4) No need to average left and right volumes to get an average measure for each subfield and brain region, since the reported data from CT is already averaged bilaterally

For example: `t2hipp_vol_ca1`, `t2hipp_vol_ca23`...
